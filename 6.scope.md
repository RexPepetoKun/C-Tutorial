Local Variables vs Global Variables

local variables are declared inside functions only.
global variables are declared outside functions-includes outside int main() functions.

What happens if both local and global variables are declared with same name but different values?
Whenever there is a local variable defined with same name as that of a global variable then the compiler will give precedence to the local variable.
Example:
// CPP program to illustrate
// scope of local variables
// and global variables together
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
 
// global variable
int nonsense = 5;
 
// main function
int main(){  
    // local variable with same
    // name as that of global variable
     
    int nonsense = 2;
    cout << nonsense << endl;
}

Output will print 2.

What if we want to do the opposite of above task. What if we want to access global variable when there is a local variable with same name? 
To solve this problem we will need to use the scope resolution operator,ie :: Below program explains how to do this with the help of scope resolution operator.

Example

int nonsense 5;

int main(){  
    // local variable with same
    // name as that of global variable
     
    int nonsense = 2;
    cout << nonsense << endl;    //output is 2
    cout << ::nonsense << endl;  //output is 5
}
