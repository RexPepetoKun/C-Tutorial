1. We can get the memory address of a variable by using the & unary operator


2. A pointer however, is a variable that stores the memory address as its value.
   A pointer variable points to a data type (like int or string) of the same type, and is created with the * operator.
   The address of the variable you're working with is assigned to the pointer:

```
    string food = "Pizza";  // A food variable of type string
    string* ptr = &food;    // A pointer variable, with the name ptr, that stores the address of food

    // Output the value of food (Pizza)
    cout << food << "\n";

    // Output the memory address of food (0x6dfed4)
    cout << &food << "\n";

    // Output the memory address of food with the pointer (0x6dfed4)
    cout << ptr << "\n";

```

3.  Declaring Pointers
```
    Syntax: variable_type *pointer_name {nullptr};

    Example:
    int *int_ptr{};
    double *double_ptr{nullptr};
    char *char_ptr{nullptr};
    string *string_ptr{nullptr};

```

4. Dereferencing Pointer
    - Accessing data at address pointed to by pointer using * as dereferencing operator.
    - refer to dereferencing_pointer.cpp file under Pointer folder.  
   

5. Pointer Arithmetic

- Pointer increment.
- Pointer decrement.
- Pointer addition by constant.
- Pointer subtraction by constant.
- Difference between two pointers to calculate distance between pointer.

```

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int A[5] = { 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 };
    int *p = A;
    int *q = &A[3];

    cout << "Addresses of elements of the Array:\n";
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        cout << A + i << endl;
    }

    cout << "\nOperations:\n";
    p++;
    cout << "p++:" << p << endl;
    p--;
    cout << "p--:" << p << endl;
    p = p + 2;
    cout << "p = p + 2:" << p << endl;
    p = p - 2;
    cout << "p = p - 2:" << p << endl;
    int d = q - p;
    d = d / 2;
    cout << "d = q - p:" << d << endl;
}

```

Output:
```
0xc3dbbffdf8
0xc3dbbffdfc
0xc3dbbffe00

Operations:
p++:0xc3dbbffdf4
p--:0xc3dbbffdf0
p = p + 2:0xc3dbbffdf8
p = p - 2:0xc3dbbffdf0
d = q - p:1
```


6. Pointer to an Array
```
Syntax:     data_type (*var_name)[size_of_array];
Example:    int (*ptr)[10]

// C++ program to understand difference between
// pointer to an integer and pointer to an
// array of integers.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    // Pointer to an integer
    int *p;
     
    // Pointer to an array of 5 integers
    int (*ptr)[5];
    int arr[5];
     
    // Points to 0th element of the arr.
    p = arr;
     
    // Points to the whole array arr.
    ptr = &arr;
     
    cout << "p =" << p <<", ptr = "<< ptr<< endl;
    p++;
    ptr++;
    cout << "p =" << p <<", ptr = "<< ptr<< endl;
     
    return 0;
}


```

7. Reference (or Aliases)(&):

```
The meaning of symbol & is different in an expression and in a declaration. When it is used in an expression, & denotes the address-of operator, which returns the address of a variable, e.g., if number is an int variable, &number returns the address of the variable number (this has been described in the above section).

Howeve, when & is used in a declaration (including function formal parameters), it is part of the type identifier and is used to declare a reference variable (or reference or alias or alternate name). It is used to provide another name, or another reference, or alias to an existing variable.

Syntax: 
type &newName = existingName;
// or
type& newName = existingName;
// or
type & newName = existingName;  // I shall adopt this convention

It shall be read as "newName is a reference to exisitngName", or "newNew is an alias of existingName". You can now refer to the variable as newName or existingName

```
