Common Errors while using Pointers;

1. Unitialized Pointers
- int *int_ptr; //pointing anywhere
- int_ptr =100; // hopefully a crash

2. Dangling pointers aka wild/stray pointers
- Pointer pointing to released memory:
a)2 pointers point to same memory
b)1 pointer releases the data with release
c)The other pointer accesses the release data

- Pointer that points to invalid memory.

3. Not checking if new failed.
- if 'new' fails, an exception is thrown.
- we use exception handling to catch exceptions
- dereferencing a null pointer will cause program to crash

4. Memory Leak
- forget to release allocated memory with delete
- if you lose your pointer to the storage allocated on the heap,you have no way of getting to the storage again
- reason being: when memory is dynamically allocated on the heap, no name is given.
- memory is orphaned or leaked
