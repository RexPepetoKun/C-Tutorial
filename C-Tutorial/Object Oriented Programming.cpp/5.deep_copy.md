This code defines a class called "Deep" that has a single private data member called "data," which is a pointer to an int. The class has several member functions:

"set_data_value" sets the value of the int pointed to by "data" to a given value.

"get_data_value" returns the value of the int pointed to by "data".

The constructor "Deep(int d)" dynamically allocates memory for an int and initializes it with the value passed as an argument.

The copy constructor "Deep(const Deep &source)" makes a deep copy of the object being passed as an argument. It does this by allocating new memory for the int and initializing it with the value of the int pointed to by "source.data."

The destructor "~Deep()" frees the memory allocated for the int pointed to by "data."
There is also a function called "display_deep" that takes a Deep object as an argument and displays its data value.

In the main function, an object called "obj1" is created and initialized with the value 100. The "display_deep" function is then called with "obj1" as an argument, causing its data value to be displayed. Then, an object called "obj2" is created as a copy of "obj1" using the copy constructor. Finally, the "set_data_value" function is called on "obj2" to set its data value to 1000.
